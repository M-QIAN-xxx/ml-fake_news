Will be predicting whether a headline and article text represents real or fake news from words that appear. For this purpose, **implemented Naive Bayes algorithm from scratch without using any external Machine Learning library** and used Bag-of-words model with different parameters. Also used Tf-idf to extract features for comparison.
